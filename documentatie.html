        HTTPS ensures that this information is encrypted during transmission and makes it much more
        difficult for third parties to intercept or steal it. Passwords will be hashed, and actions against SQL Injection were taken.
        We will also be using SSL to authenticate the identity of
        our server to users and to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

    <p>
        SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a protocol that ensures secure communication between two endpoints over the
        internet. It provides secure data transfer, encryption, and authentication between clients and servers.
